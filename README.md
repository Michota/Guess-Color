# Color guessing game

A simple web game in which the player's task is to guess which of the colors displayed on the screen corresponds to the RGB code randomly selected by the algorithm.

- The game includes "Hard Mode", a mode in which the colors are very similar to each other, which makes it even more difficult to guess which color corresponds to the drawn code.
